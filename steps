###BUILDING A LAMP STACK SERVER###
This is a small personal checklist for me for when I am building LAMP servers. Something as a reference guide for others to follow along with quickly who have some experience already with Linux.

###FIRST, YOUâ€™LL FOLLOW A SIMPLE BEST PRACTICE: ENSURING THE LIST OF AVAILABLE PACKAGES IS UP TO DATE BEFORE INSTALLING ANYTHING NEW.
command: apt-get -y update

###NOTE: WE ARE GOING TO BE USING UBUNTU 16.40 FOR THIS INSTALLATION BUT THIS PROCESS APPLIES EQUALLY TO DEBIAN IN GENERAL. HOWEVER, THE PROCESS IS A BIT MORE COMPLEX IN RPM BASED DISTRIBUTIONS LIKE RED HAT AND CENTOS. IN THOSE CASES, EACH OF THE COMPONENTS NEED TO BE INSTALLED SEPARATELY, WE WILL LIST THOSE PACKAGES BELOW IN THE PREREQUISITE SECTION.

###LAMP STACK INSTALLATION. A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS WILL BE INSTALLED INCLUDING: APACHE2, APACHE MODULES, PHP, MYSQL CLIENT, MYSQL SERVER, PHP MYSQUL MODULE FOR APACHE, AND OTHER SUPPORTING LIBRARIES.
command: "sudo apt-get install lamp-server^"

###RUN THROUGH MYSQL ADMIN CONFIG

###TESTING FOR INCOMMING HTTP CONNECTIONS:
command: telnet localhost 80
#should say connected to localhost

###PHPMYADMIN INSTALLATION
command: apt-get -y install phpmyadmin

###CHOSE APACHE2
###CONFIGURE THE DATABASE FOR PHPMYADMIN WITH DBCONFIG-COMMON? HIT YES
###FOLLOW THE REST OF THE PROMPTS
###INPUT PASSWORD FOR ADMIN ACCOUNT FOR MYSQL AND USER
###INPUT PASSWORD FOR PHPMYADMIN TO REGISTER WITH THE DB SERVER

###FINISH CONFIGURATION OF APPACHE
command: nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

###INCLUDE AT BOTTOM OF CONF FILE
# phpMyAdmin Configuration
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

###REBOOT SERVER
command: service apache2 restart
